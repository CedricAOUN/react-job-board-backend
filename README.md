# react-job-board-backend
Back-end of my react-job-board project, designed to work with: [react-job-board-ui](https://github.com/CedricAOUN/react-job-board-ui)

## Install guide: 

Download this repository and extract it.

### Database Setup
- Select a Database management system of your choosing. *(eg: [MySql Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/))*
- Create a new Database
- Import "MockDatabase.sql" provided in this repository.

You should now have a Database with a "jobbyjob_db" table, and a bunch of data.

### Starting up the server
- Make sure you have Node installed. (Open terminal/CMD and type Node -v). If not, please install it via: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Open Terminal/CMD in the folder where you extracted this repository. (.../job-board-backend)
- Type "node server.js". Your server should be up and running.

You may now head to [react-job-board-ui](https://github.com/CedricAOUN/react-job-board-ui), and follow the instructions there to setup the UI.
